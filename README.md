# Stock_Trading

Intraday trading, also called day trading, is the buying and selling of stocks and other 
financial instruments within the same day. In other words, intraday trading means all 
positions are squared-off before the market closes and there is no change in ownership of 
shares as a result of the trades.
Until recently, people perceived day trading to be the domain of financial firms and 
professional traders. But this has changed today, thanks to the popularity of electronic 
trading and margin trading.
